## AUTOMATIC ROOM TEMPERATURE CONTROLLER

## INTRODUCTION

An automatic room temperature controller is a system that is used to bring the room temperature to a set level.The setup allows the user to set a desired temperature which is then compared to the room temperature measured by a temperature sensor. With the help of a microcontroller, the system responds by turning ON the cooler or heater. When there is no person inside the room the controller switches of the system.

## REQUIREMENTS

## High Level Requirements:

LLR 1	|A Microcontroller is used for controlling the process.

LLR 2	|Ultrasonic sensor is used to check whether there is person.

LLR 3	|A thermistor shall be used to check the temperature of the room.

LLR 4	|A relay shall be used to switch ON the cooler or heater.

## Components Description

## Microcontroller
Microcontroller is used to control the overall process in automating the refill of water ito the tank.

## Thermistor
Two water level sensors are used to detect the water level. One for detecting if the tank is empty and another one detecting the top level of the tank.

## Ultrasonic sensor
Relay circuit is used to switch on and off the relay based on the signals received from microcontroller.

## Keypad
AC Power supply is given to the circuit inorder to run it.

## Relay
Rectifier is used to convert 230 V AC power supply into 5 V DC power supply. Since, microcontroller and DS 1307 are digital electronic devices they operate only in DC power supply.

## LCD Display
A buzzer is used to alert the user once the tank is filled.

## APPLICATIONS

• Houses

• Offices

• Hospitals
