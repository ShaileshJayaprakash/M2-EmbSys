## About the Automatic car wiper

## 1.1	Description  
The car wipers that have been in the present day market are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention. For this purpose we use rain sensor along with microcontroller and driver IC to drive the wiper motor. Our system uses rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by microcontroller to take the desired action.
The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls on it it’s circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller. The microcontroller now processes this data and drives the motor IC to perform required action. The motor driver IC now drives a servomotor to simulate as a car wiper.

## 1.2	Identifying features

•	Rain is identified with the help of the rain sensor.  
•	Automatic wiper action is initiated without manual intervention.  
•	Microcontroller programmed system to ensure the automatic instant wiper action.  
•	When it stops raining, the wiper action automatically gets terminated.  

## 1.3	State of art

The main objective of this system is to initiate the wiper action when it rains and to terminate the same when the rain gets stopped. To ease the work of driver by eliminating the manual intervention thereby contributing to comfortable driving.
