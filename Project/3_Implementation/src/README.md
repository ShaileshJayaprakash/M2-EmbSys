### This folder contains all the coding files for the proper execution of the program

## Instructions to execute
 1.Clone my repository.
 2.Go to 3_Implementation folder.
 3.Download the .ino, .h, .cpp , simulation and .hex files.
 4.Make sure your system meets all software requirements.
 5.Open .ino file with Arduino IDE. Turn on compatibility and verify the code.
 6.After this we will get a path where we can get .hex.
 7.Open simulation file with SimulIDE.
 8.Right click on the circuit and select load firmware.
 9.To load the firmware select .hex file which was generated.
